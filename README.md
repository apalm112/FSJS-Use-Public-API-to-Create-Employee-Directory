## FSJS Project #5: Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory

This project uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random employees and use that data to build a prototype for an employee directory. It will request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
